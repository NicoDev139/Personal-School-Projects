# Personal-School-Projects
Basic programming to Data Science. 

Here is the list of personal projects with a brief explanation for each:


Project_1: Tip Calculator – User Interface Application for Apple Operating System devices. It allows users to enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values. 

Project_2: Weather Selector – A python program that allows the user to input a location (city, country or zip code). Program gathers data from openweathermap.org and prints weather information in a readable format for the selected location. 


Project_3: Graph Analysis with Matplotlib – A jupyter notebook project using gas price datasets to understand price increases in different parts of the world. The second part of the project incorporates official FIFA-Soccer datasets to understand the physical performance of soccer athletes who play the sport in different soccer clubs.


Project_4: Login and Sign-up System – A python program which requests the user to create a username and password to create an account. 


Project_5: House Market in California – A Jupyter notebook project focusing on the functionality of data science and its application in real state.  


Project_6: Dimensionality Reduction and Feature Selection – A jupyter notebook project working on Principal Component Analysis applicable in dimensionality reduction and feature selection. 


Project_7: Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.  


Project_8: Analysis and Comparison of Parking Tickets in Toronto and New York City - A Jupyter notebook project focusing in comparing and analyzing datasets from city of Toronto and New York City transportation officials to understand number of parking citations given by local law-enforcement to citizens in the years 2016 and 2017.


Project_9: Analysis of Weather Patterns to Predict Hurricanes: A Jupyter notebook project focusing on the analysis of hurricanes’ trajectory to predict patterns and landfall by deploying the Gradient Boosting Regressor Algorithm and applying the GeoPandas library to plot datapoints via (Latitude and Longitude). 


Project_10: Analysis of Housing Market in Florida and Miami: A Jupyter notebook project focusing on the increase of real estate for first time home buyers. It uses the Mean Squared Error to understand patterns between datapoints and access the most affordable home prices in Miami.
